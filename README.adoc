= TinyPounder

The TinyPounder is a GUI tool to test creation / removal / destroyal of Ehcache3 cache managers or caches.

The TinyPounder does not embed ehcache3 libraries; instead it relies on a kit (an archive that contains the ehcache libraries).

You can find Open Source Ehcache3 kits on the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases[Ehcache3 release page]  (archives that end with -kit).

== How to use

To start the TinyPounder, you can download it and start it with :

----
java -jar tinypounderXXX.jar
----

If you usually run the TinyPounder with the same kit, you can provide its path at start time :
----
java -jar tinypounderXXX.jar --kitPath=/path/to/unzipped/kit/ --licensePath=/path/to/license.xml
----

Disable auto-launch browser (when you already have a tinyPounder window)
----
java -jar tinypounderXXX.jar --autoLaunchBrowser=false
----

Then head to http://localhost:8080

== How to build

To build the TinyPounder, clone this git repo and run :
----
./mvnw clean package
----

and then start it with :
----
java -jar target/tinypounderXXX.jar
----

or, in a single step :

---
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
---
